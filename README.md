### Presentation
Shows the following solar events at the current device location for every day of a year centered on today's date:

**Times**
* _Start twilight_ - dawn
* _Sunrise_
* _Noon_ - solar, when the sun reaches it's highest point in the sky
* _Sunset_
* _End twilight_ - dusk

**Durations**
* _Sunlight_ - time between sunrise and sunset
* _Daylight_ - time between the start and end of twilight
* _Night_ - time between the end and start of twilight

All times and durations are given as hours and minutes.  AM and PM are not shown.  It should be obvious from the context which one applies.

Twilight, specifically [civil twilight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight#Definitions_and_illustrations_by_illumination), is the time during which the sun is not visible but there is enough daylight for normal daytime activities.
